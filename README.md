My solutions to the problems on http://www.pythonchallenge.com/

On pythonchallenge.com, you have to complete each level to get to the next. While the problems are not
explicitly programming challenges, coding is implicitly required to complete the challenges in a reasonable 
amount of time. These are my personal solutions to the problems.
